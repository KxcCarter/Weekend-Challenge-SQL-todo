## Features

This branch adds a feature to store the headlines of completed tasks in a small box on the lower left-hand side of the screen. Whenever a title is clicked, it is "un-completed" and moved back to the main display.

I'm not particularly enthusiastic about this feature, so I doubt I will be merging it back into the master branch.
